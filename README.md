I'm a keyboard shortcut fiend - it always bugs me that there weren't keyboard shortcuts for the Pull Request tabs ("Discussion", "Commits", and "Files").

I created [a very simple Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-pr-shortcuts/kapjepggaddjibohcedilfoeccojiink) that adds keyboard shortcuts for Pull Request pages.

# Shortcuts

* `r d` - Go to the "Discussion" Tab
* `r c` - Go to the "Commits" Tab
* `r f` - Go to the "Files" Tab

## Why `r`?

* `p` was taken for "Projects"
* `r` kind've makes sense for "Review" or "Request" (the "Pull" is silent)?
